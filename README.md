# Atom Black Syntax #

A truly black Syntax theme for Atom. It is based on Atom Dark but with a truly black background. It works best with Atom Black UI theme [http://atom.io/packages/atom-black-syntax/] here.

## Terminal Styling ##
Instructions are here: http://atom.io/packages/atom-black-syntax/

### PC ###
Also, if you are on a PC and have ConEmu, you can also download an Atom Black-compatible shell terminal emulator style [https://github.com/academicjargon/bash-profiles] here.
### Mac ###
If you are on a Mac, you can also download an Atom Black-compatible terminal style [http://atom.io/packages/atom-black-syntax/Smyck.terminal] here.

Note: This is still a work-in-progress. Will be updating as I go through the guide.
