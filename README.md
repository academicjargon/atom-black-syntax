# Atom Black Syntax #
A truly black high contrast syntax theme to go with Atom Black UI. Seriously. It's black. Expect improvements to this theme. 

## Planned Changes ##
1. Reduce the number of bold items. E.g., make string weight normal.
2. Change string color. E.g., Probably change strings to white.
3. Add Semantic .less variables. E.g., instead of @red (with a green color!), we'll use @string or @tag or @attribute or @parameter or @attributeValue ...etc
4. Clean up .less sheets with better, clearer comments and remove duplicate lines and overwritten styles
